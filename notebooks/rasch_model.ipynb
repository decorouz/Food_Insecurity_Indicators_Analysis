    "## Rasch Model\n",
    "By defining a probabilistic model that links the (unknown) measure of food insecurity to the\n",
    "(observable) responses to experience-based questionnaires, it is possible to obtain estimates\n",
    "of the former using data collected on any sample of individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest of such models that preserves all desirable qualities of a proper measurement\n",
    "model is the `Rasch` model. In this model, the probability that a respondent\n",
    "will report a given experience is a logistic function of the distance between the respondent‚Äôs\n",
    "and the item‚Äôs positions on the severity scale:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Prob(x_{h,i} = 1|Œ∏_h, Œ≤_i) =  \\frac {e^{Œ∏_h - Œ≤_i}}{1 + e^{Œ∏_h - Œ≤_i}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_{‚Ñé,ùëñ}$ is the response given by respondent *h* to item *i*, coded as 1 for ‚Äúyes‚Äù and 0 for ‚Äúno‚Äù.\n",
    "The relative severity associated with each of the experiences (the parameters $Œ≤_i$\n",
    "in the formula above) can be inferred from the frequency with which they are reported by a large sample of respondents, \n",
    "assuming that, all else being equal, more severe experiences are reported by fewer respondents. \n",
    "Once the severity of each experience is estimated, the severity of a respondent‚Äôs condition (the ùúÉ‚Ñé parameter) can be computed\n",
    "by noting how many of the items have been affirmed"
