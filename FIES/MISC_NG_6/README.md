## Data
This study is based on quantitative cross-sectional data derived from the Nigeria 2021 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS6), which is a nationally representative survey that collects sociodemographic and health indicators from both household, males and females aged 15â€“49 years.

The survey utilized a multistage stratified cluster sampling approach that employed a probability proportional to size to select enumeration areas in the first stage based on the 2006 Population and Housing Census of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (NPHC). In the second stage, 20 households were randomly selected within each enumeration area.

The downloaded data include survey data from **MICS** or NICS. For this project we shall use the MICS only.

## Data Processing/Cleaning
* The original household dateset(`hh`) comprises of 41532 dataset.
* Of these households, `33631` household didn't provide content.
* The dataset contains data from two seperate surveys (MICS and NCIS). We filter by **MICS** survey only.
* Women, men, and children data merged with the household dataset.
* After initial data preprocessing, we reduced the variables from over 300 variables to 34.
