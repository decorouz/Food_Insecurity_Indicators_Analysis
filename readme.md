# Food Insecurity: Determinants of Household Food Insecurity

Billions of people suffer from food insecurity. What does it mean to be food insecure? In this repository, we explore the determinants of houshold and individual Food Insecurity in Nigeria.

> Food insecurity is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations as the “situation when people lack secure access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food for normal growth and development and an active and healthy life.”


# Overview

These project aim to analyze various food insecurity indicators, such as the Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS), the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), and the Minimum Dietary Diversity Score for Children and women (MDDS). By leveraging data science techniques and Python/R libraries, these projects will provide insights into food insecurity patterns in urban and rural households in Nigeria.
