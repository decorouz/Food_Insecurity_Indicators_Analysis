## Dataset

The dataset for this project is the round 6 survey of 3441 households from 5 states, collected between January and February 2024 using the Food Insecurity Experience Scale survey module (FIES-SM) developed by
FAO. The can data can be requested can be requested for at [FAO Data in Emergencies Hub](https://data-in-emergencies.fao.org) (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 License). 

The DIEM-Monitoring system was established under the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The main purpose of the DIEM-Monitoring system is to collect data from households and key informants in countries prone to multiple shocks.

## FIES Questions
The current FIES-SM module include eight questions as in the table below.

| Questions                     | Severity of Food Insecurity                         |Label           |

## Objectives

The main objective of this project is:

> **To investigate some of the determinants of severe household food insecurity in 5 northern states in Nigeria.**

## Main Insights
### Quality Assurance
From the quality assurance analysis with Rasch Model to verify the validity and reliability of the FIES data, we found the following:

* The weighted **infit** statistics for the FIES data in our study were within the acceptable range of [0.7â€“1.2], which verified that the FIES data is a reliable and valid measure to assess food insecurity in this population.
* Mean Rasch Model `reliability` was 0.752. These levels of reliability for a scale comprising just eight items reflect reasonably good model fit.
