    "# How do household coping strategies evolve with increased food insecurity. An examination of Food Price Shock of 2015-2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "This study examines the changes in the types and severity of coping mechanisms for food insecurity resulting from the food price shock caused by the oil price crash, currency devaluation, removal of energy subsidy and restrictions on foreign exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "1. What is the trend of the food insecurity status of Nigerian households from 2015, 2018 to 2024.\n",
    "2. Provide emperical evidence on the nature of coping strategies commonly adopted in Nigeria.\n",
    "3. Analyze the changes in the types and severity of food insecurity coping behaviors for 2015 and 2024. Specifically, we compare Nigeria's General Household Survey Panel data from 2018, when oil prices where high (or had only recently fallen), with data from 2024, when oil prices had been persistently low, the total removal of fuel subsidy,  and the currency had been devalued.\n",
    "4. Examine the way households have coped with food insecurity and how the coping behavior has evolved over time with the increased escalation of real food prices.\n",
    "5. Furthermore, the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of food-insecure households that influence the adoption of some specific strategies are analyzed. It is noteworthy that this study is the very first to empirically examine the coping strategy responses triggered by the 2023 removal of fuel subsidy and the currency devaluation imposed by Nigeria (Tinubu government).\n",

    "### Coping Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Such coping strategies, broadly categorized as food- and non- food-based techniques adopted to meet basic needs, reflect the degree of vulnerability of the\n",

    "\n",
    "Some examples of these strategies include purchasing less of the preferred food,\n",

This statistics include the proportion of households coping with FI, the prevalence of each speicific coping behaviour, and the proportion of the household within each class of severity and food insecurity.\n",
    "2. Descriptive statistic and significant tests on the means of variables (eg total expenditure) of interest by classification (e.g, coping vs non-coping) to illustrate the difference between groups\n",
    "3. Hurdle regression is implementated to asses the determinants of household coping with FI in Nigeria in 2015, 2018 and 2024. The first stage of the hurdle regression is a logistic regression showing whether or not the household engages in any of the coping behaviors. The second stage, conditional on a household coping, is a negative binomial on the count of coping behaviors in which a household engages (using frequency index as the dependent variable). We conduct a statistical test to confirm that a hurdel model is indeed, necessary due to the excess number of zero in the number of coping behaviors.\n",

    "5. Poison Model. A common approach to modeling count data is Poisson regression. When performing Poisson regression we're assuming our count data follow a Poisson distribution with a mean conditional on our predictors.\n",
    "6. Logistic regression on households struggling with moderate and intense food insecurity to investigate the factor that tip a household into the most severy coping behaviors, most of which involves the household running out of food entirely at times.
