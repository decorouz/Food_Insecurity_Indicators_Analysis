# Determinants of household dietary diversity (HDDS) in 5 northern state of nigeria
The dietary diversity tool has been proposed and used by FAO to
measure and quality and diversity of food consumed by household during a defined reference period.

# Hypothesis

# Methods of Data Analysis

Frequency distribution, mean, percentage distribution and standard deviations were employed. `Chi-square` analysis was employed for comparing groups such as sex of household head, marital status, education, agricultural activities, shocks(selected shocks), and one-way ANOVA for comparing groups like household size, and land-holding size.


# Definition of Variables
## Dependent Variable
Household Dietary Diversity (HDD) Status

* Low HDDS = 0 (if the dietary diversity score of households is less than four)
* Medium HDDS = 1 (if four to six)
* High HDDS = 2 (if more than six).


## Independent Variables

* State
* HH Gender
* Household Age
* HH Education
* Agricultural Activity
* Climatic Shocks (Drought, Flooding, Plant and Animal Diseases)
* Household size
* Landsize
* Total Income ($)
* Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)

### EDA
From the exploratory data analysis, we found out the following:


# Descriptive Statistic Tables
* Descriptive statistics for hdds categories and their p values
* Household dietary diversity category
* Comparison of HDDS by State

# Modelling 
[Ordinal logistic regression](https://cscu.cornell.edu/wp-content/uploads/91_ordlogistic.pdf) model was
used to determine the relationship between the dependent variables and a set of independent variables
