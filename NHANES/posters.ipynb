    "# Investigating the Impact of Dietary Patterns (HEI-2020) on Cardiovascular disease CVD Risk Factors in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Populations Using NHANES 2021–2023\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of mortality globally, disproportionately\n",
    "affecting racial/ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Dietary patterns,\n",
    "measured by the Healthy Eating Index 2020 (HEI-2020), are critical determinants of CVD risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: To evaluate the relationship between HEI-2020 scores and CVD risk factors among\n",
    "racial/ethnic minorities and low-income groups using NHANES 2021–2023 data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Population Selection:\n",
    "* Include participants aged ≥18 years.\n",
    "* Define racial/ethnic minorities as non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Asian participants.\n",
    "* Define socioeconomic disadvantage using the poverty income ratio (PIR) &lt;1.3.\n",
    "* Exclude individuals with incomplete data on dietary intake or CVD risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dietary Assessment:\n",
    "* Calculate HEI-2020 scores using 24-hour dietary recall data.\n",
    "* Categorize HEI-2020 scores into quartiles for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## CVD Risk Factors:\n",
    "* Assess systolic/diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, and fasting\n",
    "glucose.\n",
    "* Include obesity metrics (BMI, waist circumference).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Covariates:\n",
    "* Adjust for age, gender, acculturation, smoking status, physical activity, and comorbidities (e.g.,\n",
    "diabetes).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Analysis Plan\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "* Summarize participant characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, PIR) by HEI-2020 quartiles.\n",
    "* Report means (±SD) for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bivariate Analysis:\n",
    "* Compare CVD risk factors across HEI-2020 quartiles using ANOVA or chi-square tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multivariate Analysis:\n",
    "Primary Model: Linear regression to assess the association between HEI-2020 scores and\n",
    "continuous CVD risk factors (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol).\n",
    "* Secondary Model: Logistic regression for binary outcomes (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia).\n",
    "* Include interaction terms to test for effect modification by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic\n",
    "status.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sensitivity Analysis:\n",
    "* Stratify analyses by racial/ethnic group and socioeconomic status.\n",
    "* Exclude participants with self-reported heart disease to test robustness."
